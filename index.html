          <h3>Who I Am</h3>
            <p>Hello!  It's nice to have you here.  I am an aspiring software engineer currently in Florida.  I studied geology at the University of Miami and also lived in Prague for a year teaching English.  Currently taking a software engineering bootcamp, I cannot wait to update my website with my projects as I go along!</p>

          <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>I graduated from the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science at the University of Miami in 2016 with a BA in geology and minors in mathematics and classics.  I have experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I am in the process of switching careers and am looking to become a software engineer - either front-end, back-end, or both.  I am taking a bootcamp in software engineering at Flatiron School and will be graduating in April 2023.</p>
